                            <p>[Edits International] helped me finalize the text for a collection of papers on Soviet foreign policy. The original text was written in English and included translations from Slavic languages as well.</p>
                            <p>The work was done in a very short time. The editor helped me clarify important points and greatly improved the style of the text while still maintaining my particular perspective. Following the publication of the collection, I received compliments from American colleagues about the precision and clarity of the language.</p>
                            <p>[My editor] was extremely patient in discussing changes to the text. With very rare professional skills and human qualities, she was one of the best editors I have ever met.</p>
